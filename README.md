# MyVS_project
My pilot stages in coding with VISUAL STUDIO.

Desciption:
as noted above, here will be a display of my Toddler steps in coding with the famous VISUAL STUDIO tool.
As is usually the case with learning, my amature capacity might be noted in the "ingenuity"(ha, ha, ha...) of the resulting 
codes at the initial stages; however, you will enjoy the ride with me as my professionality zooms to an Alarming
and Amazing level in no time. This README file will be revised from time to time as the journey progesses.

Aim:
The basic aim is to have a collection of my primitive VS codes to reminiscence about when i become a PRO and have
the nostalgic desire to travel down Memory Lane to the beginning of my Newbie steps in coding on Visual Studio.
It will also serve as a point of reference for the basics of coding in general.
